    "## Multicollinearity and Regression Analysis\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will again be using the spatial dataset of county-level election and demographic statistics for the United States. This time, we'll explore different methods to diagnose and account for multicollinearity in our data. Specifically, we'll calculate variance inflation factor (VIF), and compare parameter estimates and model fit in a multivariate regression predicting 2016 county voting preferences using an OLS model, a ridge regression, a lasso regression, and an elastic net regression.\n",
